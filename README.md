Note: If you're wondering how using padding-bottom: 30%; in the CSS will set the height for the squares then see <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5657964/css-why-doesn-t-percentage-height-work/5658062#5658062">here.</a>
TL;DR: "When you specify the height or width as a percentage, that's a percentage with respect to the element's parent."
